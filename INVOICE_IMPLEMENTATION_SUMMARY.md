## üì¶ Dependencies Added

### NPM Packages
```json
{
  "jspdf": "^2.5.2"
}
```

**Installation Command:**

```

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Connect to Supabase
psql -h <your-db-host> -U postgres -d postgres

# Run migration
\i supabase/migrations/create_invoices_table.sql

# Verify tables
\dt invoices
\d invoices

# Test RLS
SELECT * FROM invoices; -- As admin
SELECT * FROM invoices; -- As customer (should see only raised invoices)
```

### 2. Frontend Deployment
```bash
# Build production assets
npm run build

# Deploy to hosting (Netlify/Vercel/Cloudflare)
# Build output: dist/
```

### 3. Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required. Uses existing Supabase configuration.

### 4. Settings Configuration
Ensure the following settings exist in `settings` table:
- **Category:** `shop`
  - `shop_name` (e.g., "Nirchal Sarees")
  - `shop_address_line_1`, `shop_address_line_2`
  - `shop_city`, `shop_state`, `shop_postal_code`, `shop_country`
  - `shop_phone`, `shop_email`
- **Category:** `billing`
  - `billing_gstin` (GST Identification Number)
  - `billing_pan` (PAN Number)

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Invoice not showing for delivered order
**Solution:** Check invoice status - must be 'raised', not 'generated'

### Issue: PDF download fails
**Solution:** 
1. Check console for base64 decoding errors
2. Verify `pdf_base64` column has data
3. Test with: `atob(pdfBase64)` in browser console

### Issue: Generate button not working
**Solution:**
1. Check payment_status is 'completed' or 'paid'
2. Verify no existing invoice for that order
3. Check console for service errors

### Issue: RLS denies access
**Solution:**
1. Verify user is authenticated
2. Check `profiles.role` is 'admin' for admin access
3. Test RLS with: `SELECT current_user;`

### Issue: Invoice number not incrementing
**Solution:**
1. Check sequence: `SELECT nextval('invoice_number_seq');`
2. Reset if needed: `ALTER SEQUENCE invoice_number_seq RESTART WITH 1000;`

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Database
- ‚úÖ 7 indexes for fast queries
- ‚úÖ Composite indexes for common filter combinations
- ‚úÖ TEXT column for base64 (avoids BYTEA overhead)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large base64 data - consider LIMIT in queries
- üí° Recommendation: Archive old invoices annually

### Frontend
- ‚úÖ Loading states prevent multiple requests
- ‚úÖ Bulk operations reduce API calls
- ‚úÖ Search is client-side (fast filtering)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Base64 to Blob conversion happens in memory
- üí° Recommendation: Implement pagination for large datasets

### PDF Generation
- ‚úÖ jsPDF is lightweight (160KB gzipped)
- ‚úÖ Templates are consistent and fast
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Server-side generation blocks request
- üí° Recommendation: Consider background job queue for bulk operations

## üéØ Future Enhancements

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
1. Email invoice to customer on raise
2. Preview invoice before downloading
3. Regenerate invoice functionality
4. Invoice cancellation/void support
5. Export invoices as CSV/Excel

### Medium-term (Next Quarter)
1. Multiple GST rates support
2. Invoice templates customization
3. Multi-currency support
4. Invoice analytics dashboard
5. Automated invoice generation on order delivery

### Long-term (Future Releases)

2. Credit note generation
3. Invoice series customization
4. Bulk email to customers
5. API endpoints for external systems

---

## üìù Notes & Assumptions

1. **GST Rate:** Hardcoded to 18% - change `gst_rate` default in table if needed
2. **Financial Year:** April to March (Indian FY) - see `generate_invoice_number()` function
3. **PDF Storage:** Base64 in database - consider cloud storage for scale
4. **Invoice Visibility:** Admin must manually "raise" - automation can be added
5. **Order Requirement:** Only orders with payment_status = 'completed' or 'paid'
6. **Company Settings:** Fetched from `settings` table - ensure data exists
7. **Customer Identification:** Based on order.customer_id matching auth.user_id
8. **Download Tracking:** First download sets `downloaded_at` - subsequent downloads don't update
