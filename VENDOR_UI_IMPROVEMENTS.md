# Vendor Listing UI Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Contact Info Column Alignment
**Problem:** The "Contact Info" column header was not aligned with the column content in the vendor listing table.

**Solution:** 
- Updated CSS selectors for vendor tables (4-column layout) to ensure exact padding alignment
- Modified `.admin-table .admin-table-col-1:nth-last-child(3)` selectors to have consistent padding
- Set both header and content padding to `16px` for perfect alignment
- Added specific styling for contact info content with proper spacing and typography

### 2. Outdated Modal Design
**Problem:** The modal design looked basic and outdated, not matching the modern admin interface.

**Solution:** 
- **Enhanced Modal Overlay:**
  - Added backdrop blur effect with `backdrop-filter: blur(4px)`
  - Increased overlay opacity from 0.5 to 0.6 for better focus
  - Added smooth fade-in animation

- **Modernized Modal Container:**
  - Increased border radius from 8px to 12px
  - Enhanced shadow with multi-layer box-shadow
  - Added subtle gradient backgrounds for header and footer
  - Implemented slide-up animation for smooth appearance

- **Improved Modal Elements:**
  - **Header:** Increased padding, added gradient background, better typography
  - **Close Button:** Glass morphism effect with backdrop blur, hover animations
  - **Content:** Better spacing, improved typography, scrollable content area
  - **Footer/Actions:** Enhanced button styling with hover effects and transforms

- **Enhanced Form Elements:**
  - Increased input padding and border radius
  - Added focus states with subtle background changes
  - Modernized checkbox styling with custom checked state
  - Better spacing between form elements

- **Button Improvements:**
  - Added hover transform effects (subtle lift)
  - Enhanced shadow effects on hover
  - Better disabled states
  - Improved color transitions
