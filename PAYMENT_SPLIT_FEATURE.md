# Payment Split Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Customers can now choose to split their payment between products and services:
- **Option 1**: Pay full amount upfront (Products + Services)
- **Option 2**: Pay for products now + Pay for services on delivery (COD)

## Use Case
When a customer orders both products (like sarees, lehengas) and services (like Faal & Pico, custom stitching), they can:
1. Pay the full amount online
2. OR pay only for products online and pay for services when they receive the finished products

## Implementation Details

### 1. Checkout Page Changes

#### Payment Split Calculation
```typescript
const calculatePaymentSplit = () => {
  let productTotal = 0;
  let serviceTotal = 0;

  items.forEach(item => {
    const itemTotal = item.price * item.quantity;
    // Services identified by size === 'Service' or 'Custom'
    if (item.size === 'Service' || item.size === 'Custom') {
      serviceTotal += itemTotal;
    } else {
      productTotal += itemTotal;
    }
  });

  return { productTotal, serviceTotal };
};
```

#### UI Components Added
1. **Payment Options Radio Buttons** (Only shown when cart has both products and services)
   - Full Payment option - highlighted in amber
   - Split Payment option - highlighted in green, marked as "Recommended"

2. **Dynamic Pricing Summary**
   - **Full Payment Mode**:
     - Subtotal
     - Delivery
     - Total
   
   - **Split Payment Mode**:
     - Products Subtotal
     - Services Subtotal
     - Delivery
     - **Pay Now (Products)** - in amber box
     - **Pay on Delivery (Services)** - in green box
     - Order Total

### 2. Order Processing

#### Razorpay Integration
- When split payment is selected, Razorpay order is created with:
  - Amount = Products total (not full order total)
  - Notes include:
    ```typescript
    {
      payment_split: 'yes',
      online_amount: productTotal,
      cod_amount: serviceTotal,
      payment_note: "Split Payment: Products â‚¹X (Paid Online) + Services â‚¹Y (COD)"
    }
    ```

#### Order Storage
- Order total_amount includes both online and COD amounts
- Payment split information stored in Razorpay order notes
- Session storage saves COD amount for confirmation page

### 3. Session Storage
After successful order:
```typescript
sessionStorage.setItem('cod_amount', serviceTotal.toString());
sessionStorage.setItem('payment_split', 'true');
```

This allows the Order Confirmation page to display COD information.

## Customer Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Full Payment
1. Customer adds saree (â‚¹5,000) + Faal & Pico service (â‚¹150)
2. At checkout, selects "Pay Full Amount Now"
3. Pays â‚¹5,150 via Razorpay
4. Order confirmed

### Scenario 2: Split Payment
1. Customer adds saree (â‚¹5,000) + Faal & Pico service (â‚¹150)  
2. At checkout, selects "Split Payment"
3. UI shows:
   - Pay Now (Products): â‚¹5,000
   - Pay on Delivery (Services): â‚¹150
4. Pays â‚¹5,000 via Razorpay
5. Order confirmed with note to pay â‚¹150 on delivery
6. When finished saree is delivered, customer pays â‚¹150 cash

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Mark service payment as collected
- [ ] Track service payment collection rate

### Order Confirmation Page
- [ ] Display COD amount prominently
- [ ] Show payment breakdown in order details
- [ ] Reminder about service payment on delivery

### Email Templates
- [ ] Include COD amount in order confirmation email
- [ ] Send reminder about service payment before delivery
- [ ] Delivery notification should mention COD collection

### Delivery Integration

## Technical Notes

### Payment Flow
1. Customer selects split payment
2. Frontend calculates: `onlineAmount = productTotal`, `codAmount = serviceTotal`
3. Razorpay order created with `amount = onlineAmount`
4. Order stored with `total_amount = onlineAmount + codAmount`
5. Razorpay notes contain split payment details
6. Session storage saves COD amount
7. Order confirmation shows payment breakdown

### Database Considerations
- Current: No separate COD field in orders table
- Payment split info stored in Razorpay order notes
- Total amount includes both online + COD

### Recommended Database Updates (Future)
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders 
ADD COLUMN cod_amount DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN cod_collected BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN cod_collected_at TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN payment_split BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

## Database Schema

### Orders Table - New Columns
```sql
-- COD payment columns added to orders table
cod_amount         NUMERIC(10, 2) DEFAULT 0.00    -- Amount to be collected on delivery
cod_collected      BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE          -- Whether COD has been collected  
online_amount      NUMERIC(10, 2) DEFAULT 0.00    -- Amount paid online
payment_split      BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE          -- Whether order used split payment

-- Indexes for performance
idx_orders_cod_pending      -- Fast filtering of pending COD collections (WHERE cod_amount > 0 AND cod_collected = FALSE)
idx_orders_payment_split    -- COD analytics queries
idx_orders_cod_status       -- COD collection status queries
```

### Migration File
- **Location**: `add-cod-columns.sql`
- Adds 4 new columns to orders table
- Creates 3 performance indexes
- Includes column comments for documentation
- Includes verification queries
- Includes COD analytics sample queries
