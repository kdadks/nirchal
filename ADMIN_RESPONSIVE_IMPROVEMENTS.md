# Admin Dashboard Responsive Design Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive responsive design improvements made to the admin dashboard to ensure optimal functionality across various screen sizes, including 10-inch tablets and 14-inch laptops.

## Key Issues Addressed
1. **Modal positioning** - Modals were getting hidden behind navigation on smaller screens
2. **Variant section layout** - Quantity and price boxes were mixing up on 14-inch laptops
3. **Bulk operations alignment** - Button alignment issues on smaller screens
4. **Navigation responsiveness** - Sidebar and header not optimized for intermediate screen sizes
5. **Form layouts** - Product forms and other admin forms not properly responsive

- **Tablet**: 481px to 768px
- **Small Laptop**: 769px to 1024px
