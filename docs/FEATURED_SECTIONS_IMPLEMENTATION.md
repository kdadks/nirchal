# Dynamic Featured Sections - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Created a fully dynamic featured sections system that replaces the old `is_featured` boolean field. Admins can now create, edit, and manage unlimited homepage sections from the admin panel without code changes.

## Migration from `is_featured` Column

### What Changed
- **Removed**: `is_featured` boolean column from `products` table
- **Added**: New `featured_sections` and `featured_section_products` tables
- **Migrated**: All existing featured products automatically moved to "Featured Products" section
- **Eliminated**: All mock data - now using database only

### Data Migration (Automatic)
The migration script automatically:
1. Creates three default sections (Featured Products, Trending Now, New Arrivals)
2. Finds all products where `is_featured = true`
3. Adds them to the "Featured Products" section
4. Drops the `is_featured` column from products table

## Database Schema

## Usage

### Create a Section

2. Click "New Section"
3. Fill in:
   - Title (e.g., "Summer Collection")
   - Description (optional)
   - Slug (auto-generated from title)

   - Text Color (color picker)
4. Search and select products
5. Click "Create Section"

### Edit a Section
1. Click Edit icon on section row
2. Update details or products
3. Click "Update Section"

### Reorder Sections
- Drag & Drop using grip icon (future enhancement)

## Security
- RLS enabled on both tables
- Admin operations use service role (bypass RLS)
- Frontend uses public client (RLS enforced)

## Performance
- Indexed columns: `is_active`, `display_order`, `slug`, `section_id`, `product_id`
- Efficient joins with product data
- Limits applied at query level

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Drag & drop reordering in admin panel
- [ ] Automatic sections (trending based on sales, new based on date)
- [ ] Schedule sections (show/hide based on dates)
- [ ] A/B testing different section layouts
- [ ] Analytics per section (clicks, conversions)
- [ ] Image banners for sections
- [ ] Section-specific CTAs
