# Enhanced Security Mode Solution Guide

## Problem Identified
Your Supabase project is in **Enhanced Security Mode** (likely PCI DSS compliance), causing write permission errors across multiple tables.

## Test Results Summary
```
✅ READ ACCESS: Works on all tables (anon key)
❌ WRITE ACCESS: Fails on all tables with various error codes:
   - logistics_partners: permission denied (42501)
   - categories: permission denied (42501) 
   - products: permission denied (42501)
   - vendors: RLS policy violation (42501)
   - orders: schema cache issue (PGRST204)
```

## Solutions (Try in Order)

### 1. Check Project Security Settings
Go to your Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API → Check if:
- "Enhanced Security" is enabled
- "PCI DSS Compliance" is enabled
- API restrictions are in place

### 2. Use Service Role Key for Admin Operations
Update your admin operations to use the `service_role` key instead of `anon` key:

```typescript
// In your admin context/hooks, use service_role key
const supabaseAdmin = createClient(
  import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL,
  import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY // Use service key
)
```

### 3. Check API Key Permissions
Verify your API keys in Supabase Dashboard:
- `anon` key: Should allow read-only operations
- `service_role` key: Should allow full admin operations

### 4. Review RLS Policies for Admin Access
Ensure RLS policies allow service_role access:

```sql
-- For each table, ensure service_role can bypass RLS
ALTER TABLE logistics_partners FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy allowing service_role full access
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access" ON logistics_partners
FOR ALL TO service_role USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
```

### 5. Check User Permissions
If using custom roles, ensure your authenticated user has proper permissions:

```sql
-- Grant necessary permissions to authenticated users
GRANT ALL ON logistics_partners TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON categories TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON products TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON vendors TO authenticated;
```

## Recommended Implementation
1. Create separate Supabase clients for different access levels
2. Use service_role key for all admin operations
3. Keep anon key for public read operations
4. Implement proper authentication checks before admin operations

## Files to Update
- `src/config/supabase.ts` - Add admin client
- `src/hooks/useAdmin.ts` - Use admin client for write operations
- Environment variables - Add service_role key
