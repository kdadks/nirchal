# Password Reset System - Production Deployment

## Overview
This package contains the necessary database functions and deployment instructions for the password reset system to work in production.

## Critical Database Changes Required

The password reset modal system requires these database functions to be executed in your **production Supabase database**.

### Files to Deploy:

1. **`production-password-reset-functions.sql`** - Complete database functions (REQUIRED)
2. **Frontend code** - Already committed and deployed with the main application

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Database Functions Deployment

1. **Access your production Supabase project**
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor

2. **Execute the SQL file**
   - Copy the contents of `production-password-reset-functions.sql`
   - Paste into the SQL Editor
   - Execute the query

### Step 2: Verify Deployment

After executing the SQL, verify the functions work:

```sql
-- Test 1: Check if functions exist
SELECT routine_name, routine_type 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name IN ('request_password_reset', 'reset_password_with_token');

-- Test 2: Test password reset request (replace with real email)
SELECT request_password_reset('your-test-email@example.com');

-- Test 3: Test password reset with token (use token from step 2)
SELECT reset_password_with_token('generated-token', '$2b$12$hashedpasswordexample');
```

### Step 3: Frontend Deployment

The frontend code has already been committed and should be deployed with your regular deployment process.

## What This Fixes

### Before (Issues):
- ❌ Password reset emails not being sent
- ❌ Password reset modal showing "Failed to reset password"
- ❌ Database functions missing or incorrect

### After (Working):
- ✅ Password reset emails sent successfully
- ✅ Password reset modal working completely
- ✅ Secure token generation and storage
- ✅ Proper password hashing and validation
- ✅ Token cleanup after successful reset

## Security Features

- **Secure token generation**: 32-character random tokens
- **Token expiration**: 1 hour validity
- **Password hashing**: bcryptjs with 12 salt rounds
- **No email disclosure**: Same response whether email exists or not
- **Token cleanup**: Automatic token removal after use
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive error handling

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the SQL execution logs for errors
2. Verify your email service configuration (Netlify functions)
3. Test with the verification queries above
4. Check the browser console for frontend errors

## Files in this deployment:
- `production-password-reset-functions.sql` - Database functions
- `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - This file
- Frontend modal system (already in main codebase)

**⚠️ Important**: The database functions MUST be executed in production for the password reset system to work. The frontend code alone is not sufficient.
